ingredients:
- 1 cake konnyaku (devil’s tongue jelly)
- salt
- 1 giant white radish (daikon)
- 6 cakes ganmodoki (a type of deep-fried bean curd) or grilled bean curd (yakidofu)
- 6 hard-boiled eggs, shelled
- 4 chikuwa (fish paste rolls)
- 2 cakes kamaboko (fish paste)
- 6 cakes satsuma-age (deep-fried kamaboko)

ingredients2_title: for simmering
ingredients2:
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 4 cups dashi (see dashi recipe here.)
- ¾ cup light soy sauce
- ¾ cup mirin
- 1 tsps salt

ingredients3_title: serve one, some, or all of the following
ingredients3:
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 4 cups dashi (see dashi recipe here.)
- ¾ cup light soy sauce
- ¾ cup mirin
- 1 tsps salt

prepare_steps:
- Use a large, flameproof earthenware pot which disperses slow, constant heat throughout the walls of the vessel, or any wide and not very deep cooking pot.
- Heat the chicken stock and dash over low heat, When simmering, add the soy sauce and mirin. Finally, add salt little by little, tasting often, till flavor suits you.
- Add the konnyaku and daikon first, then the other ingredients in the order listed. The last are the fish products. Simmer on a very low heat at least 90 minutes. Do not cover. Be sure to use enough stock—the ingredients at the beginning of the simmer should almost float.
- By the time the oxen is ready to serve, the broth should be reduced by 1/3 at least and should be medium dark, about the color of hotcake syrup.
- Bring the pot to the center of the table for everyone to help themselves. Mustard is the orthodox spice with oden.

cook_steps:
- Rub konnyaku with salt, lightly pound and wash, then cut into triangles about ½ inch thick with sides about 2.5 inches.  (You will find the taste of konnyaku a lot better with this process)
- Peel the giant white radish and cut into 1-inch rounds or half-moons, depending on the size of the root. Boil in water to cover till tender (when the radish can be easily pierced with a toothpick). (You will find the taste of radish a lot better with this process)
- Pour boiling water over the ganmodoki to remove excess oil, drain, and cut into halves or quarters, depending on the size of the cake (just cut grilled bean curd into 1-inch cubes).
- Cut the fish products—chikuwa, kamaboki, and satsuma-age—into 1.5-inch pieces.
- Leave the boiled and shelled egg whole.

It’s almost the end of 2015, I still can’t decide what dish I’m gonna cook for New Year’s Eve. A week ago, when David’s brother visited from the east coast, we pigged out on otoro, wagyu beef and oysters until we all felt sick ( how could that even happen? ) It was like the dream came true about living in the food heaven. The day after David’s brother left, I stared at my lunch for half an hour, totally lost my appetite. Later that night, David’s brother texted me and complained about losing his appetite too. So I asked David, are we going to take a “food” off on New Year’s Eve?

There must be something simple yet satisfying out there I can serve on our table! And Oden came to my mind!

Oden is a kind of comfort food we like to enjoy in the winter time in east Asia. During winter, you can see white steams come out from street carts, little shops or even convenience stores serving oden. In Japan, people like to eat oden and drink sake at food stands with their coworkers. Simply look at the white steam come out of the food carts makes me feel comfy and happy.

So Oden it is. It’s so simple and delicious so that we can invite some friends over, have a cozy night without breaking a sweat. For people who don’t know what oden is, it’s similar to hotpot or stew with kelp and bonito based stocks. Combining ingredients that give flavor with others that absorb (fish products with radish, bean curd, konnyaku or boiled eggs) and simmer everything over a very low heat for a long time. This dish originated in the Kanto area surrounding Tokyo Bay, once rich in tiny seafood, and began as fish dumplings eaten with miso. These dumplings were served on bamboo skewers and came to be known as dengaku, after an ancient dance. This was soon shortened to just den and given the honorific o.
