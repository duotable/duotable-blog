recipe_title: Primary Dashi 一番出し
recipe_subtitle:
ingredients_subtitle: makes 1 quart serves 6 as base for clear soup
ingredients:
- 1-quart cold water
- 1-ounce giant kelp (konbu)
- 1 ounce dried bonito flakes (hana-katsuo)

prepare_steps:
- Fill a medium-sized soup pot with 1-quart cold water and put in the kelp. Heat, uncovered, so as to reach the boiling point in about 10 minutes. [IMPORTANT&#58; Kelp emits a strong odor if it is boiled, so remove konbu just before water boils.]
- Insert your thumbnail into the fleshiest part of the kelp. If it is sort, sufficient flavor has been obtained. If tough, return it to the pot for 1 or 2 minutes. Keep from boiling by adding approximately ¼ cup cold water.
- After removing the konbu bring the stock to a full boil. Add ¼ cup cold water to bring the temperature down quickly and immediately add the bonito flakes. No need to stir.
- Bring to a full boil and remove from the heat immediately. If bonito flakes boil more than a few seconds, the stock becomes too strong, a bit bitter, and is not suitable for use in clear soups. If you make this mistake, all is not lost, use the stock as a base for thick soup or simmered food.
- Allow the flakes to start to settle to the bottom of the pot (30 seconds to 1 minute). Remove foam, then filters through a cheesecloth sieve. Reserve the bonito flakes and kelp for secondary dashi.

recipe2_subtitle:
recipe2_ingredients_subtitle: makes 3-4 cups
recipe2_ingredients:
- bonito flakes and giant kelp reserved from primary dashi
- 1.5 quarts cold water
- 1/3-½ ounce dried bonito flakes (hana-katsuo)
recipe2_prepare_steps:
- Place the bonito flakes and giant kelp reserved from the primary dashi in 1.5 quarts cold water in a medium-sized soup pot. Place over high heat just until the boiling point, then reduce heat and keep at a gentle simmer until the stock is reduced by 1/3 or ½, depending on the flavor desired. This reduction takes about 15-20 minutes.
- Add the fresh bonito flakes and immediately remove from heat. Allow the flakes to start to settle to the bottom of the pot (30 seconds to 1 minute), and remove foam from the surface. Filter liquid through a cheesecloth sieve.
- Discard the bonito flakes and konbu.

Dashi, Japan’s all-purpose soup stock and seasoning. Stands figuratively if not literally at the right hand of every Japanese chef. Different varieties of dashi lend subtle depth to a wide variety of soups and entrees. Dashi provides Japanese cuisine with its characteristic flavor, and it can be sand without exaggeration that the success or failure (or mediocrity) of a dish is ultimately determined by the flavor and quality of the dashi that seasons it. Making good dashi is the first secret of the simple art of Japanese cooking.

There are two kinds of dashi, primary dashi （一番出し）and secondary dashi（一番出し）. Primary dashi has a lovely fragrance, fresh primary dashi is best for clear soups. A Japanese clear soup should be thin enough to allow one to clearly perceive the flavors of the other ingredients present. Its bouquet disappears quickly and is lost if the dashi is not used immediately. Secondary dashi, with its thicker taste, is good as a basic seasoning—for thick soups, noodle broths, or as a cooking stock for many dishes.
